              Res 29(5): 1386-1392, 2015-The isometric squat has been used to
              detect changes in kinetic variables as a result of training;
              however, controversy exists in its application to dynamic
              multijoint tasks. Thus, the purpose of this study was to further
              examine the relationship between isometric squat kinetic
              variables and isoinertial strength measures. Subjects (17 men,
              1-repetition maximum [1RM]: 148.2 +/- 23.4 kg) performed squats 2
              d.wk for 12 weeks and were tested on 1RM squat, 1RM partial
              squat, and isometric squat at 90 degrees and 120 degrees of knee
              flexion. Test-retest reliability was very good for all isometric
              measures (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.90); however,
              rate of force development 250 milliseconds at 90 degrees and 120
              degrees seemed to have a higher systematic error (relative
              technical error of measurement = 8.12\%, 9.44\%). Pearson
              product-moment correlations indicated strong relationships
              between isometric peak force at 90 degrees (IPF 90 degrees ) and
              1RM squat (r = 0.86), and IPF 120 degrees and 1RM partial squat
              (r = 0.79). Impulse 250 milliseconds (IMP) at 90 degrees and 120
              degrees exhibited moderate to strong correlations with 1RM squat
              (r = 0.70, 0.58) and partial squat (r = 0.73, 0.62),
              respectively. Rate of force development at 90 degrees and 120
              degrees exhibited weak to moderate correlations with 1RM squat (r
              = 0.55, 0.43) and partial squat (r = 0.32, 0.42), respectively.
              These findings demonstrate a degree of joint angle specificity to
              dynamic tasks for rapid and peak isometric force production. In
              conclusion, an isometric squat performed at 90 degrees and 120
              degrees is a reliable testing measure that can provide a strong
              indication of changes in strength and explosiveness during

              between weightlifting performance (snatch, clean and jerk, and
              total) and variables obtained from the isometric mid-thigh pull
              (IMTP). METHODS: Twelve weightlifters, ranging from novice to
              advanced, performed the IMTP 10 days after a competition.
              Correlations were used to evaluate relationships between
              variables of the IMTP and absolute and scaled competition
              results. RESULTS: Unscaled competition results correlated
              strongly with IRFD (0-200ms: r=0.567-0.645, 0-250ms:
              r=0.722-0.781) while results correlated weakly with Peak IRFD
              (5ms window, r=0.360-0.426). Absolute peak force values
              correlated very strongly with absolute values for the competition
              performance (r=0.830-0.838). Force at 100ms, 150ms, 200ms and
              250ms also correlated strongly with competition results
              (r=0.643-0.647, r=0.605-0.636, r=0.714-0.732, r=0.801-0.804).
              Similar findings were noted for allometrically scaled values.
              CONCLUSION: Measures of average IRFD probably represent a more
              relevant variable to dynamic performance than does Peak IRFD
              (5ms). Maximum isometric strength also is likely to have a strong
              role in weightlifting performance.",

              execution of a skill or his/her physical development. Obtaining
              data of the highest quality and minimising error requires an

              the process by which data are transferred, processed and

                     alike desire maximal performance with the game of golf,
                     and often encounter musculoskeletal injuries in their
                     quest to perform at the highest level possible. The most
                     common injury associated with golf is low back pain. The
                     purpose of this paper is to review the physical
                     conditioning approaches to minimize the incidence and

              alterations and relationships among training variables,
              performance variables, and physiological variables and 2)
              investigate the effects of strength training on potentiation
              complexes. Methods: The study enrolled nine D-1 collegiate
              throwers and four control subjects. The throwers participated in
              an 11-week resistance training and throws program. Resistance
              training volume load and throwing volume were recorded for 11
              weeks. Measurements of maximal strength (isometric mid-thigh
              pulls) and dynamic mid-thigh pulls (DMTP) across a spectrum of
              loads: Males- 60kg, 140kg, 180kg, 220kg, 140kg, 30\% isometric
              peak force (IPF), Females- 60kg, 80kg, 100kg, 120kg, 80kg, 30\%
              IPF), were measured at weeks 1, 7, and 11. The control group was
              tested for isometric maximum strength at T1 (week 1) and T3 (week
              11) Results: The throwers increased at each time point in
              isometric peak force (IPF), allometrically scaled IPF (IPFa), and
              isometric impulse. The throwers strength (IPF and IPFa) was
              significantly greater than the controls and the throwers
              experienced statistically significant changes in maximum strength
              from T1 to T3 when compared to the controls. The throwers
              demonstrated statistically significant changes in total load
              variables (variable for load 1+ load 2 + load 3 etc.) for DMTPs.
              Conclusion: As a whole these data suggest a potential for
              increased performance capabilities specific to throwing. Some
              data trends indicate that potentiation can occur as a result of
              performing a heavy pull before a lighter one. However, increasing
              maximum strength as a result of focusing on strength training did
              not enhance this potentiation effect.",

              repetition maximum [1RM] hang power clean [HPC]: 104.9 +/- 15.1
              kg) performed sets of the HHP at 30, 45, 65, and 80\% of their
              1RM HPC. Peak force, peak velocity, peak power, force at peak
              power, and velocity at peak power were compared between loads.
              Statistical differences in peak force (p = 0.001), peak velocity
              (p < 0.001), peak power (p = 0.015), force at peak power (p <

              greatest values for each variable occurring at 80, 30, 45, 80,

              indicated that larger differences in velocity at peak power
              existed as compared with those displayed by force at peak power.
              It seems that differences in velocity may contribute to a greater

              force during the HHP. Further investigation of both force and

              jumps as part of an ongoing athlete monitoring program. Reactive
              strength index-modified, JH, and TTT values for each team were
              compared using 1-way analysis of variance. Statistically
              significant differences in RSImod (p < 0.001), JH (p < 0.001),
              and TTT (p = 0.003) existed between teams during the unloaded
              jumping condition. Similarly, statistically significant
              differences in RSImod (p < 0.001), JH (p < 0.001), and TTT (p =
              0.028) existed between teams during the loaded jumping condition.
              Men's soccer and baseball produced the greatest RSImod values
              during both the unloaded and loaded jumping conditions followed
              by women's volleyball, men's tennis, women's soccer, and women's
              tennis. The greatest JH during unloaded and loaded jumping
              conditions was produced by men's baseball followed by men's
              soccer, women's volleyball, men's tennis, women's soccer, and
              women's tennis. Men's soccer produced shorter TTT compared with
              men's baseball (12.7\%) and women's soccer (13.3\%) during the
              unloaded and loaded jumping conditions, respectively. Collegiate
              sport teams exhibit varying reactive strength characteristics
              during unloaded and loaded jumping conditions. Understanding the
              differences in RSImod between sports may help direct the creation
              of training and monitoring programs more effectively for various
              sports.",

  abstract  = "Monitoring tests are commonly used to assess weightlifter's
               preparedness for competition. Although various monitoring tests
               have been used, it is not clear which test is the strongest
               indicator of weightlifting performance. Therefore, the purpose
               of this study was to (1) determine the relationships between
               vertical jump, isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) and weightlifting
               performance; and (2) compare vertical jumps to IMTP as
               monitoring tests of weightlifting performance in a large cohort
               of male and female weightlifters. Methods: Fifty-two competitive
               weightlifters (31 males, 21 females) participated in squat and
               countermovement jump testing (SJ, CMJ), and IMTP testing
               performed on force plates. All laboratory testing data was
               correlated to a recent competition where the athletes had
               attempted to peak. Results: Squat jump height (SJH) was the
               strongest correlate for men and women with the Sinclair Total (r
               = 0.686, p $\leq$ 0.01; r = 0.487, p $\leq$ 0.05, respectively)
               compared to countermovement jump height (r = 0.642, p $\leq$
               0.01; r = 0.413, p = 0.063), IMTP peak force allometrically
               scaled to body mass (r = 0.542, p $\leq$ 0.01; r = −0.044, p =
               0.851) and rate of force development at 200 ms (r = 0.066, p =
               0.723; r = 0.086, p = 0.711), respectively. Further, SJH was a
               stronger correlate of relative weightlifting performance
               compared to IMTP peak force in females (p = 0.042), but not male
               weightlifters (p = 0.191). Conclusions: Although CMJ and IMTP
               are still considered strong indicators of weightlifting
               performance, SJH appears to be the most indicative measure of
               weightlifting performance across a wide-range of performance
               levels. Thus, SJH can be used as a reliable measure to monitor
               weightlifting performance in male and female weightlifters.",

              professionals to improve exercise technique, provide accurate
              feedback, and predict exercise 1 repetition maximum. There is
              still limited research on velocity-based training and currently
              only one research study on the pull-up exercise. The primary
              purpose of this research was to determine whether the maximum
              number of pull-ups an individual can perform can be predicted by
              the MCV of a single pull-up repetition. Forty-nine healthy men
              and women were recruited who reported they could do at least 2
              pull-ups. Each subject performed a standardized warm-up, then a
              single pull-up repetition, followed by one set of pull-up
              repetitions to failure. The GymAware PowerTool, a linear position
              transducer, was used to measure the MCV of each pull-up
              repetition. Both the MCV of the single repetition and first
              repetition of the set to failure were recorded, and the greater
              of the 2 was used in later analysis. Weighted least squares
              linear regression was used to estimate the relationship between
              the single-repetition MCV and maximum amount of pull-up
              repetitions. We observed a statistically significant linear
              relationship between the maximum number of pull-ups and the MCV
              of a single pull-up repetition (y = -6.661 + 25.556x, R = 0.841).
              Prediction of the maximum pull-up number by a single repetition

              relationship of velocities in the back squat between one
              repetition maxi- mum (1RM) and submaximally loaded repetition
              maximum (RM) conditions, specifically in regard to what has been
              described as the minimal velocity threshold (MVT). The MVT
              describes a minimum concentric velocity that an individual must
              reach or surpass in order to successfully complete a repetition.
              Design: To test the presence of a MVT, participants were tested
              for 1RM and RM back squat ability. The mean concentric veloci-
              ties (MCV) of the last successful repetition of each condition
              were then compared. Methods: Fourteen male participants familiar
              with the back squat volunteered to participate in the current
              study (age = 25.0 y $\pm$ 2.6, height = 178.9 cm $\pm$ 8.1, body
              mass = 88.2 kg $\pm$ 15.8). The mean concentric velocity (MCV)
              during the last successful repetition from each testing condition
              was considered for the comparison. Results: Results indicated a
              non-significant negative relationship of MCV between the 1RM and
              RM conditions (r = -0.135), no statistical difference between
              testing conditions (p = 0.266), with a small-to-moderate effect

              that MVT should be further investigated to enhance its use in the
              practical setting. Additionally, coaches considering using a
              velocity-based approach for testing athletes should use data from
              either 1RM or RM conditions, but not both interchangeably.
              Coaches should be cautious when considering group averages or

              isometric midthigh pull in bent (125° knee and 125° hip angles)
              and upright (125° knee, 145° hip angle) positions in subjects
              with (>6 months) and without (<6 months) substantial experience

              evaluate the effect of pull position and weightlifting experience
              on peak force, force at 50, 90, 200, and 250 ms. There were

              statistically significant interaction effects for peak force,

              is that the upright body position (125° knee and 145° hip) should
              be used given that forces generated are highest in that position.
